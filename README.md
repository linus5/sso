**sso** — lovingly known as *the S.S. Octopus* or *octoboils* — is the
authentication and authorization system BuzzFeed developed to provide a secure,
single sign-on experience for access to the many internal web apps used by our
employees.

It depends on Google as its authoritative OAuth2 provider, and authenticates
users against a specific email domain. Further authorization based on Google
Group membership can be required on a per-upstream basis.

The main idea behind **sso** is a "double OAuth2" flow, where `sso-auth` is the
OAuth2 provider for `sso-proxy` and Google is the OAuth2 provider for `sso-auth`.

In a nutshell:

- If a user visits an `sso-proxy`-protected service (`foo.sso.example.com`) and does not have a session cookie, they are redirected to `sso-auth` (`sso-auth.example.com`).
   - If the user **does not** have a session cookie for `sso-auth`,
     they are prompted to log in via the usual Google OAuth2 flow, and then
     redirected back to `sso-proxy` where they will now be logged in (to
     `foo.sso.example.com`)
   - If the user *does* have a session cookie for `sso-auth` (e.g. they
     have already logged into `bar.sso.example.com`), they are
     transparently redirected back to `proxy` where they will be logged in,
     without needing to go through the Google OAuth2 flow
- `sso-proxy` transparently re-validates & refreshes the user's session with `sso-auth`
